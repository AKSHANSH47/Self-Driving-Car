        Create a RecordReader object

        Parameters
        ----------
        base_directory : string
            The absolute path to the directory immediately above the
            dataset folders. For example /root/data. RecordReader expects
            to find folders like dataset_1_18-04-15, dataset_1_18-04-15,
            etc. in the base directory that you specify
        batch_size : int
            Number of records per batch. Defaults to 50 records
        overfit : boolean
            Indicates whether the model should be trained and validated
            on the same data. I use this when I'm training on images
            that the model got horribly wrong (or recorded disengagements
